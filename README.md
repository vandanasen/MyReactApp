# WCTD WEB RE-DESIGN

### At WCTD we utilize all needed internal projects as learning opportunities and work experience for anyone that is willing to apply themselves. The [We-Connect-The-Dots Website](https://wctd.org) is no exception.

### [FIGMA WIREFRAME](https://www.figma.com/proto/Sym7f3RbiuwNvZpMvu1Vv8/WCTD_MasterFile-HiFidelity?node-id=1416%3A4351&scaling=min-zoom)

We had a team of volunteers that built the [wireframe](https://www.figma.com/proto/Sym7f3RbiuwNvZpMvu1Vv8/WCTD_MasterFile-HiFidelity?node-id=1416%3A4351&scaling=min-zoom) to analyze, create-user stores, do user testing, and re-design the website. 

This GitHub repo is the actual development of the website. 

For WCTD Developer reference: [DevOps environment](https://dev.azure.com/nebulaeducation). Must be accessed with @nebulaacademy.org email address.
